Abstract: The smart city will become a reality thanks to M2M communications, which will result in significant changes in the applications and services offered to inhabitants. The latest trend in M2M development is discussed first, followed by an examination of the framework for constructing smart city application systems in this article. An event manager is then utilised to coordinate and cooperate among M2M components utilising an event-based architecture based on the SOFIA project. Based on this concept, we give a case study in a vehicle setting. M2M network architecture is introduced for vehicular networks. Finally, the mission-critical wireless messages are controlled by a vehicle maintenance services event processing flow.
